a. Description / Purpose - My WebAPI centers around sports players and being able to retreive, modify, insert, and delete data from an external MySQL database. I created a Player class which consisted of a player's name, age, sport, team, and position. I then created MySQL queries to interact with the external database to get the desired results whether it was database modification or just data retreival.

b. Dependencies - Postman (aids with Get, Post, Put, and Delete), MySqlWorkbench (supports the database), VSCode (aids with API files and the MySQL file can also be accessed here)

c. Usage - This program can be used to extract player information from a database as a whole, by their name, by their sport, and by their team. This program also allows you to modify existing player's information, add new players to the database, and delete players from the database.

d. Future Work - In the future, I would hope that this program would become more user friendly and possibly implement more functions to access player information.

e. What is your major and how this project is related to your major. - I am double majoring in Nursing and Information Systems, and this project is related to my major because it centers around working with databases and pulling out desired information from them using certain specifiers. Alongside this, I get to work with and craft the methods used to retreive the information from the database.
